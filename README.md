# Famous Quotes — Internet Computer (Motoko + JS)

A minimal scaffold for a “Famous Quotes” decentralized app on the **Internet Computer**. It pairs a **Motoko** backend canister with a simple **JavaScript** frontend and a standard **DFX** workflow for local development and deployment. Built from the IC project template so you can customize quickly and iterate safely.

> If your folder was created with a default name (e.g., `icpqoutes`), you can keep it or rename to match this repo (e.g., `famousquotes`).

---

## ✨ What’s inside

- **Motoko canister** (backend): add functions like `addQuote(text)`, `getRandomQuote()`, `listQuotes()`.
- **Static frontend** (HTML/CSS/JS): display, add, or fetch quotes.
- **DFX workflow**: run a local replica, deploy canisters, generate candid interfaces.
- **Webpack dev server**: quick frontend iteration with API proxy to the replica.

---

## 🧰 Prerequisites

- **DFX SDK** (Internet Computer)  
- **Node.js** (for `npm` scripts)

---

## 🚀 Quick start (local)

```bash
# 1) enter your project folder
cd famousquotes/   # or the folder name created by dfx new

# 2) explore help
dfx help
dfx canister --help

# 3) start a local replica (background)
dfx start --background

# 4) deploy canisters (backend + assets)
dfx deploy
```

### Generate (or refresh) candid declarations for the frontend:
```
npm run generate
```

### Start the frontend dev server:
```
npm start
```

## This serves at:

- Frontend: http://localhost:8080
- Replica/API: http://localhost:4943 (proxied by the dev server)

## 🗂️ Project structure (high-level)

```
famousquotes/
├─ src/                    # backend canister + frontend assets (IC template)
├─ dfx.json                # canister + network config
├─ package.json            # scripts & deps
├─ webpack.config.js       # web build config
├─ tsconfig.json           # TS tooling (if present)
└─ README.md
```

## 🧪 Suggested next steps
- **Motoko actor**
  - addQuote(text : Text) — append a new quote
  - getRandomQuote() : ?Text — fetch a random quote
  - listQuotes() : [Text] — list stored quotes
  - Use stable vars or persistent structures for data across upgrades
- **Frontend**
  - Form to add quotes, list with pagination, “random quote” button
  - Basic validation + max length
- **Testing**
  - Candid-driven integration tests
  - Motoko unit tests for core logic
 
## 🌐 Deploying to mainnet (optional)
```
# authenticate / choose identity as needed
dfx deploy --network ic
```

Ensure cycles and canister settings are configured appropriately.

## ⚙️ Frontend environment notes
If you host the frontend without using DFX, make sure it does not fetch the root key in production. Options include:
- Set setDFX_NETWORK to ic if using Webpack
- Replace process.env.DFX_NETWORK in autogenerated declarations via your own method
- In dfx.json, set:
```
canisters -> {asset_canister_id} -> declarations -> env_override
```
to replace process.env.DFX_NETWORK
- Write your own createActor constructor

## 📝 Scripts (common)
- dfx start --background — start local replica
- dfx deploy — build + deploy canisters
- npm run generate — regenerate candid declarations
- npm start — run the frontend dev server

# icpqoutes from the Internet Computer

Welcome to your new icpqoutes project and to the internet computer development community. By default, creating a new project adds this README and some template files to your project directory. You can edit these template files to customize your project and to include your own code to speed up the development cycle.

To get started, you might want to explore the project directory structure and the default configuration file. Working with this project in your development environment will not affect any production deployment or identity tokens.

To learn more before you start working with icpqoutes, see the following documentation available online:

- [Quick Start](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/quickstart/hello10mins)
- [SDK Developer Tools](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/build/install-upgrade-remove)
- [Motoko Programming Language Guide](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/build/cdks/motoko-dfinity/motoko/)
- [Motoko Language Quick Reference](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/motoko-ref/)
- [JavaScript API Reference](https://erxue-5aaaa-aaaab-qaagq-cai.raw.icp0.io)

If you want to start working on your project right away, you might want to try the following commands:

```bash
cd icpqoutes/
dfx help
dfx canister --help
```

## Running the project locally

If you want to test your project locally, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Starts the replica, running in the background
dfx start --background

# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interface
dfx deploy
```

Once the job completes, your application will be available at `http://localhost:4943?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.

If you have made changes to your backend canister, you can generate a new candid interface with

```bash
npm run generate
```

at any time. This is recommended before starting the frontend development server, and will be run automatically any time you run `dfx deploy`.

If you are making frontend changes, you can start a development server with

```bash
npm start
```

Which will start a server at `http://localhost:8080`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 4943.

### Note on frontend environment variables

If you are hosting frontend code somewhere without using DFX, you may need to make one of the following adjustments to ensure your project does not fetch the root key in production:

- set`DFX_NETWORK` to `ic` if you are using Webpack
- use your own preferred method to replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` in the autogenerated declarations
  - Setting `canisters -> {asset_canister_id} -> declarations -> env_override to a string` in `dfx.json` will replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` with the string in the autogenerated declarations
- Write your own `createActor` constructor
